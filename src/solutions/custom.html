        <p>
          We want our customers to have a great experience developing solutions using our APIs. As such, we have created a support
          offering called Client Web Services that includes activation of access from your instance of SAP Concur to the APIs to
          build your integrations. If you already have this service activated and you have been granted access rights to the Web
          Services Administration function in SAP Concur, then you can utilize the resources here to begin your development
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don’t have this service activated or aren’t sure, please engage with your company’s SAP Concur administrator in
          order to proceed.
