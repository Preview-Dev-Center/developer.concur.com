                        <p>We’re looking for qualified ISVs and third party developers with compelling integration ideas to solve real business problems for SAP Concur’s 40 million business travelers and 33,000 enterprises worldwide. If your business is well established and you’re committed to develop, market and support your integration, then we’d like to talk with you about our Platform Partner Program (fees apply). Click the link below to send an email to our Platform & Partner Solutions business development team.</p>
                        <p>Your email should include a brief description of your company (years in business, number of employees and brief description of your business). Also please describe the integration scenario/application that you are looking to offer via the App Center and provide names of joint customers who are requesting the integration. Please also review the API documentation available at this site to assess if the integration you have in mind is practical. We only pursue partnerships that are technically feasible via the available APIs and are compelling to a large number of SAP Concur clients and/or their users. Please know that we have many requests and we cannot respond to every inquiry. If you do not hear back from us this may be because the integration you are proposing does not meet our selection criteria.</p>
